From the Preface: "This is a translation of an old book - indeed, in Internet time, it is a translation of an ancient text." That text is Lessig's "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace." The second version of that book is "Code v2." The aim of Code v2 is to update the earlier work, making its argument more relevant to the current internet.Code v2 was written in part through a collaborative Wiki. Lessig took the Wiki text as of 12/31/05, and then added his own edits. Code v2 is the result.
