This is just test data for Whiteout. Both of them are licensed CC BY-SA, thus
if you copy them from here (I have no idea why you would do that) you're bound
by those terms. The audio is by /Brad Sucks/ at www.bradsucks.net and the text
is by Lawrence Lessig. I think that covers my legal obligation here.
